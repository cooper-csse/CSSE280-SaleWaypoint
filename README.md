## About

### Customers

This is an app for gamers. This would be a place to help gamers save money
on the games they want.

### Background for the Opportunity / Problem

Gamers today are often on many platforms from PlayStation, to Steam, to the
Nintendo eShop and more. Many of these stores offer deals for their games on
a regular basis, but these deals don’t help anyone if we don’t know they’re
happening. With this app, we could find games to add to our wishlist, and
then get a notification when the game goes on sale on whichever platform the
game happens to be sold on.
